# Configuration for NakedAndAfraid plugin
# Compatible with Minecraft 1.8â€“1.21.8.
# This config file is made for version 2.0.0.

# If you want to use special characters in this document, such as accented letters, you MUST save the file as UTF-8, not ANSI.
# If you receive an error when the plugin loads, ensure that:
#   - No tabs are present: YAML only allows spaces
#   - Indents are correct: YAML hierarchy is based entirely on indentation
#   - You have "escaped" all apostrophes in your text: If you want to write "don't", for example, write "don''t" instead
#   - Text with symbols is enclosed in single or double quotation marks
